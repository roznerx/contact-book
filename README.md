# "Create a simple Contact Book app" challenge by reactpractice.dev 

Made by **roznerx** (ignaciorosner@gmail.com)

- Days sixteen and seventeen of the challenge, now doing a contact form!
- This was easy but fun, especially having the chance to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) for the styles
- Last time I was thinking of creating a branch for previous projects so I could refactor everything with **TypeScript**: turns out part of the challenge was to use it here!
- Using the mock data provided by the exercise to display some cards when the page loads
- Added some tiny extras such as the Alert component

**NOTE:** so good to use interfaces for props!
